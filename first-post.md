# Creating a Blog App

I hope for this blog to be a space for me to talk about the software projects that I'm working on. What better way to start than to publish an article about my work on creating this site itself.

## Designing My Blog Application

I want for my blog to be pretty simple. In particular, I want to have four main components:

- A home landing page with my latest articles and a short description about myself. Maybe a photo or something too.
- A reusable article page that will display the title, text, and any images or code snippets I might include.
- A page to display my resume and make it available for download.
- A page all about who I am, where I work, and what I generally enjoy doing outside of software development.
