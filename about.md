Hello, my name is Branden Vennes and I am a junior software developer at a midsize software company.

I put this blog together to help me reflect on new skills and technologies I come across. I also hope to give reviews of books, chat about something I find interesting, or throw my opinion into the web.

Thanks for stopping by and check back soon for more articles!
